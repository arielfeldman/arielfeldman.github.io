            <h7><p class="w3-medium w3-display-right  w3-padding-large w3-text-white", style="margin:auto;width:37%">During my undergraduate career, I have found enjoyment in the intersection of the fields of engineering and neuroscience, the former of which Iâ€™d had little to no exposure to until coming to Rice. However, I have become deeply interested in how an engineering background enables me to further probe and interact with the brain, ultimately allowing for more innovative methods of decoding neural activity. In the Kemere Lab, I am working to understand the role of the hippocampus in both spatial navigation (see RELevator below) and learning/memory (check out Shark-Wave). In my graduate and post-graduate careers, however, I would like to move more towards working on decoding the underlying neural activity of memory and consciousness, ideally to the point of understanding where replication through computer simulations becomes feasible.</p></h7><br>
