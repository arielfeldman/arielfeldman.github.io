      <h1>Academic Fellow</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Academic Fellowships at Rice University aim to identify students who perform exceptionally in a certain course, major or field that may be able to provide free, on-call academic aid to students who reside in their residential colleges.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">My role as an Academic Fellow falls into three main components: Computer Science, Neuroscience and research. The demands of the first two are relatively simple; help students complete course work, prepare for exams and understand difficult material
        by holding weekly office hours, as well as additional hours by appointment. I also put together packets discussing difficult topics from some of my more 'in demand' courses in order to supplement lectures and allow students to access links and material I discovered while
        taking the course that really helped me. As for research, generally I help students identify potential PIs, send emails to professors, navigate their first few years of research (including independent research), prepare posters/presentations for conferences, find off campus
        opportunities (such as conferences, REUs and other summer opportunities for international students), and prepare academic papers.

      <h1>Teaching Assistant</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Teaching assistants are selected by professors on the basis of past class performance, understanding of material and willingness to help others via grading and weekly office hours.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I have been a teaching assistant for two classes at Rice: Fundamentals of Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience (NEUR 385/585) and Introduction to Computational Thinking (COMP 140).
        For the former, I held weekly office hours in addition to planning and leading review sessions before exams. In the latter course, I not only held these hours but I also graded both homeworks and exams.
        Neither course provided TAs with answer keys until after assignment deadlines, so I took these opportunities to reinforce what I'd learned in years before in addition to helping current students.

        <h1>Mentorship</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">When I first came to Rice University, I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the best mentors I could have asked for. Thus, I want to make that impact on others, as I know how much
          I appreciated the help I received.
        </h5>
  
        <p class="w3-text-grey">As a hopeful academic, I see it as my duty to help the next generation of neuroengineers by taking undergraduates interested under my wing and helping them identify any opportunities
          that may interest them. In my senior year, I formally took on an undergraduate mentee, Elisabeth Torres-Schulte, who showed incredible competence and enthusiasm in my early meetings with her.
